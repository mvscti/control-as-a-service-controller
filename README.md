# control-as-a-service-controller
The software in question creates and instantiates virtual machines, each emulating a fog node, to select potential controllers to provide control-as-a-service (CaaS) in a computing fog environment.
Features such as processing capacity (MIPS), available memory, battery, signal strength and mobility are used to create a rank-based function and select the nodes that have the most potential to exercise the role of fog controller,
similar to the mechanism proposed at https://doi.org/10.23919/SOFTCOM.2019.8903606
